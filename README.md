## About Me ##

As I delve into the depths of my being, it may seem peculiar to describe myself using Physics concepts, but I delight in intertwining the realms of Physics and Mathematics into every aspect of my life.

***As I imagine myself as a quantum particle, I find myself in a state of superposition, akin to*** **Schr√∂dinger's Cat**. ***It's intriguing to think that until someone enters my room and observes me, my true state remains uncertain, existing as a combination of possibilities.***

In this quantum analogy, the probability of finding me engrossed in reading a Physics paper in my room is high, just as it is for me **doing Physics stuffs** or **engaging in coding/graphing**. 

Mathematically, I can be described by a wave function 

![lagrida_latex_editor (3)](https://github.com/Riddhiman2005/Riddhiman2005/assets/130882317/107658fc-4896-4fef-a5f6-6cd76307aad2)

where the square of its absolute value determines the likelihood of finding me in a particular state.

As I reflect on this quantum perspective, I recognize that my level of enthusiasm is intimately tied to my inherent creativity and thinking. It's these qualities, represented by matrix A, that contribute to shaping my state of mind.

In this formula, $C$ represents the **inherent creativity**, and **$C_1, C_2, ..., C_n$**  denote various aspects or facets of creativity that contribute to shaping your state of mind. Similarly, **T** represents **thinking**, and **$T_1, T_2, ..., T_n$** represent different dimensions of thinking.


Moreover, there lies a mysterious challenge before me

waiting to be unraveled. I believe that cracking this enigma requires the profound tools of Mathematics (M) and Physics (P). By harnessing the power of these disciplines, I can navigate the unknown and bring clarity to the hidden truths.

## HOBBIES ##

   ### GRAPHING AND CODING ###
   
   üìà & üë®‚Äçüíª I thoroughly enjoy coding and graphing as they allow me to 
  unleash my creativity and create fascinating plots and artwork. Using languages like Python and graphing tools like Desmos, I can bring my ideas to life by combining mathematical equations with visual representation. It's an exhilariting experience that merges the logic world of coding and mathematics with the artistic flair, resulting in captivating and visually pleasing creations. With each line of code and graph, I dive deeper into a world where science and art beautifully intertwine, offering endless possibilities for exploration and expression.

 There are lot more. Whenever I'm free I open [Desmos Graphing](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) and spend my time trying some form of creative things. I'll upload my works from time to time. Also I run a [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@riddhiman.bhattacharya6568) where I upload the videos of the plots,and graphs. Make sure to visit it.
  
 ###  ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY ###
    
    üî≠ Sky observation is a passion of mine. The beauty and mystery of the stars, planets, a
    nd galaxies fascinate me. I love capturing these objects through my telescope and camera, and exploring the wonders of the universe. 
    It's a intriguing experience that always leaves me in awe.

## BOOKS ##

### Everlasting Quest for Physics-I ###

This book, inspired by my friend **Wrick Pal**, is a culmination of my gratitude for his unwavering support and motivation.This book not only delves into my observational works in Physics but also explores topics beyond the school curriculum.

**Physics is the philosophy to understand the functioning of the Universe at its most
fundamental level using the tools of mathematics,
everlasting curiosity and imagination**. 
 
 <br>

The initial chapters of the book explore mathematical aspects, including **Spherical Trigonometry**. Moving forward, we discuss intriguing theorems such as **Fourier's**, **Taylor's**, and **Euler's Theorems**. Later, we delve into the fascinating realms of **Relativity** and **Quantum Mechanics**, specifically focusing on **Schr√∂dinger's Quantum World**. The book concludes with a discussion on Cause-Effect Relationships, Cosmos under the Lenses of Thermodynamics, the drakness of night sky, the enigmatic nature of Time and matter-antimatter's presence.

Throughout the text, I have strived to present explanations and insights, incorporating relevant examples, videos, and links to further explore these captivating subjects. From intriguing paradoxes to philosophical implications, this book seeks to illuminate the world of Physics, offering a unique perspective and emphasizing the interplay between mathematics and observation.

I've tried to engage readers in thought-provoking discussions on various paradoxes and their applications in quantum physics. The journey through these concepts may be challenging but ultimately rewarding, unveiling the intricate nature of the quantum world.
