- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning **Python üêç** and **Fortran**



## HOBBIES ##

   ### GRAPHING AND CODING ###
   
   üìà & üë®‚Äçüíª I thoroughly enjoy coding and graphing as they allow me to 
  unleash my creativity and create fascinating plots and artwork. Using languages like Python and graphing tools like Desmos, I can bring my ideas to life by combining mathematical equations with visual representation. It's an exhilariting experience that merges the logic world of coding and mathematics with the artistic flair, resulting in captivating and visually pleasing creations. With each line of code and graph, I dive deeper into a world where science and art beautifully intertwine, offering endless possibilities for exploration and expression.

  I'll upload my works from time to time. Also I run a [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@riddhiman.bhattacharya6568) where I upload the videos of the plots,and graphs. Make sure to visit it.
  
 ###  ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY ###
    
    üî≠ Sky observation is a passion of mine. The beauty and mystery of the stars, planets, a
    nd galaxies fascinate me. I love capturing these objects through my telescope and camera, and exploring the wonders of the universe. 
    It's a intriguing experience that always leaves me in awe.

 ###  BLOGS AND ARTICLES ###
     
     üìù I publish a basic and interesting physics [here](everlastingquestforphysics.wordpress.com) 
     aimed at engaging general students in science. My goal is to make 
     science more accessible and enjoyable for everyone, and I believe that by breaking down complex concepts and 
     making them easy to understand, I can help inspire a love of learning in my readers.

## Programming Languages ##

I'm learning a lot of things. Though I'm not expert in coding, I can do a little bit. Out of my own interesting I've learnt or to say am learning 
the enlisted languages


  1) **JAVA**
  2) **C**
  3) **C++**
  4) **Python**
  5) **Fortran**
  6) **Html**


## Addictions ##

So, you thought this is going to be Instagram reels or Facebook?  No, that's not the case. 

To be honest, I'm really addicted to **GitHub** and **LaTex**. These days,  most of the time, you'll find me studying books or blogs learning GitHub and LaTex usage.

 
The other platform where I'm addicted from last few days is **Jupyter Notebook**.





## üíª [EVERLASTING QUEST FOR PHYSICS](everlastingquestforphysics.wordpress.com) ##


**Everlasting Quest for Physics(EQP)** is an initiative to provide a platform for HS students with like minded peers and teach, discuss courses which are not under normal school curriculum.
The is the [Website link](everlastingquestforphysics.wordpress.com) where I write blogs . They are mostly for general students sometimes made creative with added humor to invoke the interests for Physics and Maths 
among students.



1) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/everlastingquestforphysics/) : Here, I regularly posts some Physics stuffs.

This Diagram of the Tree is prepared by Python Coding. It's not perfect. Still, I thought to add it here.


There are lot more. Whenever I'm free I open [Desmos Graphing](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) and spend my time trying some form of creative things. I'll update this 
section from time to time.


##### 8) **Doraemon**

Done using **Python**.

## YOUTUBE ##

I recently started uploading my Graphing works in Youtube Channel. I just do it for fun, and want to improve myself through suggestions of my viewers.

Here is the Link of the channel. [YOUTUBE](https://www.youtube.com/@riddhiman.bhattacharya6568). I mostly upload my graphing and coding projects.


## Books I read in the Last One Year ##

I'm a voracious reader.  Here are some books I've read, along with brief summaries that capture their essence."
