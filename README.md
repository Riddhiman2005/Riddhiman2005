## EVERLASTING QUEST FOR PHYSICS ##


**Everlasting Quest for Physics(EQP)** is an initiative to provide a platform for HS students with like minded peers and teach, discuss courses which are not under normal school curriculum.
The [Website link](everlastingquestforphysics.wordpress.com) where I write blogs . They are mostly for general students sometimes made creative with added humor to invoke the interests for Physics and Maths 
among students.
