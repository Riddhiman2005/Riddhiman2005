## About Me ##

As I delve into the depths of my being, it may seem peculiar to describe myself using Physics concepts, but I delight in intertwining the realms of Physics and Mathematics into every aspect of my life.

As I imagine myself as a quantum particle, I find myself in a state of superposition, akin to **Schr√∂dinger's Cat**. It's intriguing to think that until someone enters my room and observes me, my true state remains uncertain, existing as a combination of possibilities.

In this quantum analogy, the probability of finding me engrossed in reading a Physics paper in my room is high, just as it is for me **doing Physics stuffs** or **engaging in coding/graphing**. 

Mathematically, I can be described by a wave function

where the square of its absolute value determines the likelihood of finding me in a particular state.

As I reflect on this quantum perspective, I recognize that my level of enthusiasm is intimately tied to my inherent creativity and thinking. It's these qualities, represented by matrix A, that contribute to shaping my state of mind.

In this formula, **C** represents the **inherent creativity**, and **C_1, C_2, ..., C_n** denote various aspects or facets of creativity that contribute to shaping your state of mind. Similarly, **T** represents **thinking**, and **T_1, T_2, ..., T_n** represent different dimensions of thinking.


Moreover, there lies a mysterious challenge before me

waiting to be unraveled. I believe that cracking this enigma requires the profound tools of Mathematics (M) and Physics (P). By harnessing the power of these disciplines, I can navigate the unknown and bring clarity to the hidden truths.

## HOBBIES ##

   ### GRAPHING AND CODING ###
   
   üìà & üë®‚Äçüíª I thoroughly enjoy coding and graphing as they allow me to 
  unleash my creativity and create fascinating plots and artwork. Using languages like Python and graphing tools like Desmos, I can bring my ideas to life by combining mathematical equations with visual representation. It's an exhilariting experience that merges the logic world of coding and mathematics with the artistic flair, resulting in captivating and visually pleasing creations. With each line of code and graph, I dive deeper into a world where science and art beautifully intertwine, offering endless possibilities for exploration and expression.

 There are lot more. Whenever I'm free I open [Desmos Graphing](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) and spend my time trying some form of creative things. I'll upload my works from time to time. Also I run a [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@riddhiman.bhattacharya6568) where I upload the videos of the plots,and graphs. Make sure to visit it.
  
 ###  ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY ###
    
    üî≠ Sky observation is a passion of mine. The beauty and mystery of the stars, planets, a
    nd galaxies fascinate me. I love capturing these objects through my telescope and camera, and exploring the wonders of the universe. 
    It's a intriguing experience that always leaves me in awe.

## BOOKS ##

### Everlasting Quest for Physics-I ###

This book, inspired by my friend Wrick Pal, is a culmination of my gratitude for his unwavering support and motivation. Initially, I wrote articles in a disorganized manner, leading me to create Part 1 of "The Everlasting Quest for Physics" series. This book not only delves into my observational works in Physics but also explores topics beyond the school curriculum.

With the support of my friends, I launched my own portal, "Everlasting Quest for Physics," on February 15, 2022. Physics, in my own understanding, is the philosophical approach to unraveling the fundamental workings of the Universe using mathematics, boundless curiosity, and imagination. I find studying Physics to be a delightful and fun experience, and my Physics teacher, Debashis Sanyal, advocates for a calm and focused approach to studying.

Physics is a subject grounded in concepts, reliant on mathematics. A strong foundation in mathematics facilitates an elegant understanding and application of Physics, although genuine interest and hard work are essential. I would like to mention Wrick Pal, whose innovative mathematical prowess always amazed me, even though he lacks enthusiasm for Physics.

The initial chapters of the book explore mathematical aspects, including Spherical Trigonometry and various operators utilized in Physics. Moving forward, we discuss intriguing theorems such as Fourier's, Taylor's, and Euler's Theorems. Later, we delve into the fascinating realms of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, specifically focusing on Schr√∂dinger's Quantum World. The book concludes with a discussion on Cause-Effect Relationships, topics beyond the curriculum, Cosmos under the Lenses of Thermodynamics, and the enigmatic nature of Time.

Throughout the text, I have strived to present explanations and insights, incorporating relevant examples, videos, and links to further explore these captivating subjects. From intriguing paradoxes to philosophical implications, this book seeks to illuminate the world of Physics, offering a unique perspective and emphasizing the interplay between mathematics and observation.

In collaboration with my friend Wrick Pal, I have engaged in thought-provoking discussions on various paradoxes and their applications in quantum physics. The journey through these concepts may be challenging but ultimately rewarding, unveiling the intricate nature of the quantum world.
