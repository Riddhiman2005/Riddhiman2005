the enlisted languages

## Addictions ##

So, you thought this is going to be Instagram reels or Facebook?  No, that's not the case. 

To be honest, I'm really addicted to **GitHub** and **LaTex**. These days,  most of the time, you'll find me studying books or blogs learning GitHub and LaTex usage.

 
The other platform where I'm addicted from last few days is **Jupyter Notebook**.





## üíª EVERLASTING QUEST FOR PHYSICS ##


**Everlasting Quest for Physics(EQP)** is an initiative to provide a platform for HS students with like minded peers and teach, discuss courses which are not under normal school curriculum.
The is the [Website link](everlastingquestforphysics.wordpress.com) where I write blogs . They are mostly for general students sometimes made creative with added humor to invoke the interests for Physics and Maths 
among students.

This Diagram of the Tree is prepared by Python Coding. It's not perfect. Still, I thought to add it here.


There are lot more. Whenever I'm free I open [Desmos Graphing](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) and spend my time trying some form of creative things. I'll update this 
section from time to time.

## YOUTUBE ##

I recently started uploading my Graphing works in Youtube Channel. I just do it for fun, and want to improve myself through suggestions of my viewers.

Here is the Link of the channel. [YOUTUBE](https://www.youtube.com/@riddhiman.bhattacharya6568)
